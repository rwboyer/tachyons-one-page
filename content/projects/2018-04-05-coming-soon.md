I've recently purged previous work to get started on something new. Having taken a break for quite a while persuing other more marketing and consulting endeavors. I thought it was time for a purge and a back to basics, minimalistic approach without any over produced, over processed material. While taking a break from image making, I did have the opportunity to play with a few personal projects on the fly.

> I have always avoided photographing in the studio. A woman does not spend her life sitting or standing in front of a seamless white paper background. Although it makes my life more complicated, I prefer to take my camera out into the street... and places that are out of bounds for photographers have always had a special attraction for me.<cite>Helumt Newton</cite>

This is a smattering from the first few sessions of a much larger project that started with a $9 white halter dress from Amazon and grew from there. I hope to curate this into something that's both visually appealing as well as an interesting social commentary.

More coming soon.

If you've ever doubted what one light is capable of look no farther than the sun. The variations of how that one light renders the world are infinite. With all of the complexity that can be brought to to the table it's always good to keep this in mind when looking for inspiration. That one light can produce amazing effects based on it's angle, it's subtle variation in color, what it's bouncing off of, what it's shining through, and infinite other variables at any given moment.

Beyond turning it all off and making use of whatever light happens to *be there*, try just using one light and one bare head in different ways. Don't worry about the optimal aperture or ISO, use whatever you have to based on where you put that one light. Be creative and use your environment in different ways. Instead of packing a lot of modifiers and reaching for the first one that comes to mind, use whatever is available. Look for things to shine that light thru, put it outside, use the shower curtain, use whatever is there to modify the light. Move it really far away and use the environment as fill.

I'll divide new tech and older tech entirely by the lights designed to work with TTL exposure control and also have extremely short flash durations. Those two things go hand in hand with Profoto's "new tech" lighting gear. The older lights across the board such as the Pro-7, Acute 2, D1, etc all have the characteristic that they have the shortest duration flash at their highest power settings. The "new tech" lights such as the Pro-10, D2, B1, B2, etc are much more like speedlights in that they go the opposite way. The shortest flash duration is at the lowest power. 

Who cares right? Well along with this there was a major shift in color temperature. Specifically the new tech lights are much cooler even in *normal mode* (meaning not freeze mode or super short duration). The big issue with this in some cases is mixing the newer lights with any of the older lights. In some cases that difference in color is extremely problematic. In other cases not so much. The other prolem is using freeze mode to optimize for the shortest flash duration possible &mdash; ostensibly a big reason why you'd want to *upgrade* in the first place. In normal mode the color consistentcy is very good across the entire 9 stop range as one would expect from Profoto. In freeze mode the color is all over the map depending on the power output level set. I can live with that under the circumstances where I'd be optimizing for extremely short flash durations to freeze motion tack sharp as long as color was consistent flash to flash which I couldn't really get a handle on this in terms of reviews or documentation. 

The photo at the top of the page is not a black and white photo. It's a color photo in a carefully controled neutral environment as not to have any bounce-back that would influence color. On a calibrated monitor or better yet looking at a precision color analysis it's completely neutral for any remotely real-world purpose. What's better is that shot-to-shot results are far more consistent than I expected them to be in freeze mode. 

The second photo is a mix of two lights and the introduction of something that's not neutral in color. One light is a Profoto B2 the second is the Profoto D2. I wanted to test the portable small light along with the studio oriented D2 both in freeze mode. I am happy to say that within similar output levels they are very close to each other. This translates to no huge considerations in mixing the two different lights as long as they are similar in actual output levels in terms of color. Obviously it's a consideration when using them in freeze mode at wildly different power levels if color balance between the two sources is imporant for the shot. So would mixing any of the newer tech lights at wildly different output power.

The bottom line is that color fluctuations in feeze mode while important to be aware of are not all over the map shot to shot or light to light. I'm impressed with this flexibility, expecially the ability to mix the B1/B2 portable battery powered lights with the mains powered D2 lights without major color considerations with or without freeze mode.

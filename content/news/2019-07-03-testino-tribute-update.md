I've worked with a couple other people now for my [towel series Testino tribute](/news/2018-06-27-testino-tribute/) mini-project. So far it's been a fun, quick, diversion that's worked generally well on a diverse set of people. I'll probably continue down the road and make a few photographs here and there while I'm working on other things. Why not?

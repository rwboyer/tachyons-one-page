>...what I try to do is a good bad picture. I work it out very carefully, and then I do something that looks as if it went wrong.<cite>Helmut Newton</cite>

There's a lot to be said for simple, intimate, pictures that have serendipity as an igredient combined with an attention to composition and moment. Shallow depth of field, hand-held freedom of movement to explore angles, and just being a fly on the wall for a given situation. Sometimes great ideas come from simplely playing. I think many times we forget how to play as we get older and *wiser*.

Play is good, play is creative, play allows freedom to explore roads you wouldn't normally go down. A rainy afternoon combined with a bizarre prop and a little bit of play were the perfect ingredients to fuel some things I will definitely use in a more "serious work" context.

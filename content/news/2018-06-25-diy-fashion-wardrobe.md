We can't all be lucky enough to have Dior one-offs at hand every day, or even any day. That doesn't mean we can't play, come up with interesting and even one-off looks. Given the chance and a coolaborator I jump at every chance I get to pull out a couple boxes of my *crap* and see what we can make that looks good. I make it a habit if I see a a $5, $10, or $20 item that has any visual interest I'll grab it and chuck it into my dress-up box.
